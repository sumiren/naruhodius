# Naruhodius (under development)

Naruhodius is a CLI-based AI software engineering agent. It aims to:
* Not only generate ideas or provide snippets, but also complete tasks and deliver tangible value.
* Proactively search for context on its own, rather than waiting for it to be provided.

⚠️ **Important Notice**  
This tool may generate or execute dangerous code. Use it responsibly and at your own risk.
